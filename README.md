# Module_6_Challenge

In this challenge, we'll use APIs in a Jupyter notebook to gather weather information for more than 500 cities situated around the equator. We'll generate scatter plots to analyze the relationship between Latitude and Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Additionally, we'll create linear regression plots to determine the correlation between these variables in comparison to Latitude.

For the second part of the challenge, we'll employ the Geoapify API to assist in planning future vacations. This involves locating hotels near us based on specific coordinates. We'll define our preferred weather conditions, and the API will aid us in identifying hotel options within 10,000 meters from our specified coordinates.

To utilize this code, it's essential to have API keys available from both Geoapify and OpenWeatherMap API. This ensures the effective retrieval of information. Initially, WeatherPy must be executed to gather the necessary data for VacationPy. Please note that a .gitignore file has been included, indicating that users must locate and input their own API keys.
